		<h3>COMSOL Conference 2015</h3>
			<h5>Information Architecture | Design | Development</h5>
			<p>The objective of this project was to re-design the existing conference site for COMSOL. The focus was to improve the visual design and implement a responsive layout. The home page of the conference was designed to emphasize the multitude of conferences available internationally for the COMSOL user. User experience was a large focus with this re-design, making sure the user was able to access information and register for the appropriate conference.</p>
