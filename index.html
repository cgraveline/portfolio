		<h3>COMSOL Video Gallery</h3>
		<h5>Information Architecture | Design | Development</h5>
		<p>The objective of this project was to re-design the existing video gallery for COMSOL. The focus was to improve the user experience and the visual design of the user interface. A more robust navigation and filtering were implemented to better assist the user in their search for content. The minimalist design and muted color scheme put more focus on the rich colors of the videos and thumbnails. The responsive layout enabled users to easily browse and view the content from any device.</p>
